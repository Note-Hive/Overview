Meeting Points

Focus on putting up issues for the project not individual. So that if there are new/other contributors they can help.

We must plan first.

Form a strategy.

No work must be done until some issues are up with proper STAR.

Do proper team management.

We're not necessarily the content writer because we can hire for them but we do the overall planning.

Create a Roadmap. Sana is the stakeholder of this.

No one is above the other with respect to the managerial position. 

Sana checks and sign-off on the roadmap after drafting.

Sana will hop into the interviews to build her team.

Study roadmap, how and why it's important, how long does it take, etc? Where is it going? (We have all materials, hives, sources that's where we are today and where were are going is the AST program , BS, MS, PhD for Hackney University that's accredited)

Do proper DMADV

Take into consideration that Sana might take maternity leave too.

Remy can help make sure our roadmap is in compliance with (HLC Approval, DEAC, ?), 

ask them how it will take time to be accredited

how we can issue F-1 visa, 

what's the process

https://www.deac.org/Seeking-Accreditation/index.aspx

Call these approval governing bodies and know what they want and that should be the end goal
18 month roadmap, begin with an end of mind.

What will HLC's parameters be?

Create a vague roadmap and slowly steer it after knowing parameters.
