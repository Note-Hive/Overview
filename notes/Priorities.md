Why start the project?

Initially there's the learn and earn program for Hackney University.

Now we have the Work-study program. Like the F-1 program Suzanne got.

For example, 4 hours of work will do 4 hours study with us. If they stayed for 4 years then they'll get a degree from HU.

Three areas to focus on, by priority:

1. [Hackney University](https://hackneyuniversity.org/) website.  It will be a .edu once accredited. 

2. Create the curriculum guides.

3. Make the Focus Grading app for the admission.

4. AST Program Creation (needs confirmed).

These guides are like creating a book. It will be like a semestral program.
