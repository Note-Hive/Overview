Why start the project?

Initially there's the learn and earn program for Hackney University.

Now we have the Work-study program. Like the F-1 program Suzanne got.

For example, 4 hours of work will do 4 hours study with us. If they stayed for 4 years then they'll get a degree from HU.

Three areas to focus on:

1. Create the curriculum guides.

2. Groom the Hackney University website. It will be a .edu once accredited.

3. Make the Focus Grading app for the admission.


These guides are like creating a book. It will be like a semestral program.
