# 📘 NAICS & Business Code Research Protocol  
**To:** Note Hive Team 
**From:** Management
**Subject:** Immediate Rework Required – Code Categorization Project  

---

## 🔎 Background

This project is the **foundation** for how we will conduct business across all companies. The accuracy of your work directly impacts:

- MAS GSA Schedule eligibility  
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) structuring  
- Website content and positioning  
- Federal and commercial contract opportunities  
- Revenue potential and market positioning

You are currently **failing this assignment** due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how Business Codes work and how they should be applied strategically.

## ❌ Issue Identified

You incorrectly attempted to change the **Primary NAICS** for INSTAR from:

- ✅ Correct: `541700 – Scientific Research and Development Services`  
- ❌ Incorrect: `541715 – R&D in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology)`

This change **narrowed the scope** of the business and **excluded major scientific domains** such as social sciences, agricultural sciences, and interdisciplinary research. This is not only factually incorrect, but it also **limits our eligibility for broader funding and contract opportunities**.

> **Reminder:** Our Management created the original NAICS classification system for our organization. Do not override it without a full strategic and financial justification. If you change things, you must provide a financial justification in your excel comment.

## ✅ Immediate Action Required

You are to **start over from scratch** on the NAICS and Business Code Research Project for all companies. Follow the exact process below **without deviation**.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔁 Phase 1: Primary Code Research

1. **Start with NAICS** – This is the foundation of all categorization.
2. **Match the business description** to the most appropriate NAICS code.
3. **Always prioritize broader codes first** (e.g., 541700 over 541715) to **maximize eligibility and funding potential**.
4. **Research funding, contract history, and scope** for each NAICS option to determine which code will **capture the most revenue** while staying aligned with the business model.
5. **Use GPT or other tools to validate your choices** and ensure you are not missing broader opportunities.

### 🟥 Code Cell Update (Excel)

- Once a code is finalized:
  - **Mark the Excel cell RED**
  - **Add a comment** explaining your rationale and include:
    - Primary NAICS
    - Secondary NAICS (if applicable)
    - Links or references to funding/contract data
  - Notify the peer review team that the code is ready.

---

### 🟨 Phase 2: Peer Review

6. Another team member must **review your work** using the same steps (1–5).
7. Once complete:
   - **Mark the Excel cell YELLOW**
   - Add the following comment format in the cell:
     ```
     FINAL:
     Primary: 541810
     Secondary: 541613, 541430, 541850
     ```
8. Announce to Management that the company is ready for final review.

## 📦 Business Codes to Complete

For **each of the companies**, you are responsible for researching and finalizing the following codes:

| Code Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **NAICS** | North American Industry Classification System – Primary business code |
| **PSC** | Product Service Codes – Used in federal procurement |
| **SIN** | Special Item Numbers – Used in GSA Schedules |
| **SIC** | Standard Industrial Classification – Legacy system, still used in some databases |

> **Always start with NAICS**, then proceed to the others once the NAICS is finalized.

## 🧠 Strategic Considerations

- **Think like a strategist, not a student.** Your goal is to position each company for **maximum revenue**, **broadest eligibility**, and **contract alignment**.
- **Avoid niche codes unless absolutely necessary.** Broader codes = more funding opportunities.
- **Use authoritative sources** such as:
  - [NAICS.com](https://www.naics.com/search/)
  - [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/)
  - [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/)
  - [Acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/)
- **Validate your codes** with GPT or another AI tool to ensure you're not missing higher-value options.

## 📈 What Comes Next

Once this foundational research is complete, we will begin:

1. Drafting **MAS GSA Schedules** for each company
2. Building **SLA Agreements** aligned to their business codes
3. Designing and launching **Websites** that reflect their NAICS-aligned capabilities

Your work here directly affects our ability to **win contracts**, **build credibility**, and **scale revenue**.

---

## 🚨 Final Reminder

If you want to **maximize funding**, you must **choose the broadest, most strategic NAICS codes** that still align with the business model. Narrowing the focus without justification is not only incorrect—it’s financially damaging.

> **You are being evaluated on accuracy, strategic thinking, and execution.**
